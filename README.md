The term big data rise under the explosive increment of global data as a technology that is able to store and
execute big and varied volumes of different kind of data, providing both science and enterprises with deep
permeance over its user experiments. Cloud computing provides a fault-tolerant, available, reliable, and
scalable atmosphere to understand big data distributed management systems. in this paper we are going to
describe an overview of both technologies and cases of success when integrating big data framework and
cloud frameworks. Although big data resolve most of our present problems and it still presents some gaps
and issues that raise a concern and need improvements such as Security problems, scalability, data
governance policies, privacy issues, data heterogeneity, disaster recovery mechanisms, and other challenges
that we see over here.
